    	<p>My name is Kameron Wagner and this is my CIS184 project. The subject for this website bloomed
           from my love for gaming. Games allow me to immerse myself in a different worlds ranging from 
           real world to fantasy. They are my self-subscribed therapy when the real world becomes too much.
    	</p>
    	<p>There are many different types of games that are popular today. Everything from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_game">RPGs</a>, 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massively_multiplayer_online_role-playing_game">MMO-RPGs</a>, and 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-person_shooter">FPSs</a> being only a few of the popular gaming types. While there are many different
            types of games available, there are also different platforms in which to play those games. The two main console power houses are Microsft, which 
            created the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_One">Xbox-One</a> and Sony, which designed and created the 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_4">PS4</a>.</p>
        <p>There are a couple other consoles available, but don't have the reputation or game diversity 
            that Microsoft and Sony have. There also exists the PC gaming realm. While there are some games that are only available on console, the same can be said 
            about PC games. As far as overall quality of gameplay goes, PC has the upper hand in every aspect. From the quality of graphics, to the processing speed
            of gameplay. One fundamental problem with console is that the processing ability will never rival that of the PC. I have the Xbox-One, PS4 and a gaming PC 
            which I built myself to cover all the bases.</p>
        <img id="graph" src="images/graph.jpg" alt="graph"/>
        <p>Due to the reason stated above, the PC gaming revenue is surpassing the console gaming as shown in the graph to the right. Games are becoming much so complex 
            and intricate that the consoles can't
            compete with the PCs abilities.</p>	
        <p>The rest of the site will give you some insight on my two favorite types of games listed in the nav menu above. I will also provide some videos of some of 
            the most popular games today. </p>
